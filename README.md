# randomCountryPerDay

Basically what this program does when executed is, it will randomly select one country (or element! it could be used as you wish, modifying the "countries.txt" and "donecountries.txt" file to list whatever you want it to) and cout it off.

It will select one of the elements of the countries.txt file and will append it to the donecountries.txt file. Each time the program has to choose again, it will check if the element is present in the donecountries.txt file. If so, the program will chose another one, and then add that one to the donecountries.txt file.

It could be used as a bingo thing I guess, choosing multiple elements from a list without repetitions. I will probably enhance it in the future to contain less repetitions and redundancies, and maybe add something more to it, like the possibility to choose more than one element, like asking how many elements you want the program to pick for you. Cheers
